    "* Simple python intented for people coming from other languages that plan to use the ideas described in the book outside of Python.\n",
    "* Many of these techniques are available as library calls. They are spelled out as for teaching purposes.\n",
    "* Resource limitations:\n",
    " * At most one day of running time per notebook.\n",
    " * No GPU required.\n",
    " * Minimal dependencies.\n",
    " * At most 8Gb of RAM.\n",
    "* Due to resource limitations, these notebooks do not undergo as much hyperparameter tuning as necessary. This is a shortcoming of these case studies, keep it in mind if you want to follow a similar path with your experiments.\n",
    "* To help readers try variants of some cells in isolation, the cells are easily executable without having to re-run the whole notebook. As such, most cells read everything they need from disk and write all their results back into disk, which is unnecessary with normal notebooks. The code for each cell might look long and somewhat unusual. In a sense, each cell tries to be a separate Python program.\n",
    "* I dislike Pandas so these notebooks are Pandas-free, which might seem unusual to some."

    "# Chapter 6: Case Study on Graph Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter I will describe the creation of the base WikiCities dataset employed in this chapter and the next three chapters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WikiCities Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "It starts with the latest release of DBpedia [cite], for October 2016, a curated ontological resource obtained from the infoboxes at Wikipedia. Infoboxes are the tabular information appearing next to the page content in each Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "My intention with this dataset is to provide a task that can be attacked with regular features, with time series features, textual features and image features. The task I found that allow for all these approaches is that of calculating the population of a city or town based on their ontological properties (e.g., name of its leader or its time zone), based on its historical population and historical features (which involves a time series analysis), based on the textual description of the place (which involves text analysis, particularly as many times further includes the population) and a satellite image of the city (which involves image processing).\n",
    "\n",
    "DBpedia files are distributed as files of triples, where a triple consists of a subject, verb and object. The subject is always an entity in the ontology, prefixed by the name space dbpedia.org. The verb is an ontological relation, of which there are many (type, leader-name, etc). The object can be either another entity or a literal value (a string or a number). Besides the actual files, DBpedia also contains links to multiple other ontologies, like Freebase or Yago plus links to the original Wikipedia articles that resulted in the extracted information. For these case studies we will be using the \"instance_types_en.ttl.bz2\", \"mappingbased_literals_en.ttl.bz2\", \"mappingbased_objects_en.ttl.bz2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "The type information is derived from the infobox itself. The first challenge is to identify cities, as the \"city\" or \"settlement\" type is not thoroughly annotated in Wikipedia. Instead of relying on heuristics (such as \"any entitity with a location and a population\" which will result in neighborghoods annotated), I chose to use an external more reliable source, the GeoNames project. The project distributes a list of \"cities or settlements with at least 1000 people\". It contains 128,000+ places (file \"cities1000.txt\"). To link them back to DBpedia we use the file \"geonames_links.ttl.bz2\" distributed by DBpedia (Cell #1)"

At this stage on the EDA process we want to look into which of these relations might make for good features. Going back to Chapter 1, we want features that will be simple, related to the target (population) and readily available. From the perspective of \"readily available\" we want to shorten down the number of relations to ones that are frequent enough that will be useful for a ML algorithm (I will look into the other issues later). Therefore their frequency over the whole set of entities is paramount. Let us sort the relations by the number of cities that have them defined (Cell #9). "

    "From all this process we are now down to 43 relations and 1.3 million triples for 48,000 instances. But we still do not have features, as these relations have multiple instances for them and are unordered. To deal with this situation, we can remember the techniques from Chapter 5 for dealing sets, lists, graphs, etc. For the set-based (unordered) nature of the relations, we can sort them. In this case we can sort them by how frequent is the target value. If the target value is more frequent, it might be more informative to the ML. That leaves then with a list of values for each relation. To represent lists, a common technique is to truncate it to a maximum size. We thus need to see how many times each of these 43 relations is defined for a given entity (Cell #11)."

    "There are multiple things we can see here. First, no relation has a minimum that it is not 1. That is good because it means no relation is inherently multiple. We can also see that the inverted relations have substantive maximums, which make sense that cities such as London will be the birthplaces of thousands of Wikipedia-worthy people. Clearly the most important signal here is the number of such inbound relations rather than the actual entities being referred, but we will leave that to be brought about by some feature selection techniques as the ones discussed in Chapter 4. Some the averages are also pretty high but they seem to be driven by few megacities. The medians are much informative, with only a few beyond one. I will thus focus on the medians and extract the file \"ch6_cell12_rels_median_fan_outs.tsv\" (Cell #12)."

    "The first thing to notice in this figure is that there seems to be many cities in the data set with less that 1,000 inhabitants. Some even with only 1 person! Looking a little bit into the triples, I can see that some are actual mistakes in Wikipedia (a city with 1,000,000 people got typed as 1.000.000, etc). Other are small towns and hamlets that are less than a 1,000 people (but might have been more than a 1,000 at the time GeoNames built their list). Following the discussion on outliers in Chapter 2, these are outliers that are worth removing from the data. I will still leave them in the held-out final test data as their impact in production needs to be seen and evaluated.\n",

    "While the RMSE is not that bad for only one feature (less that one order of magnitude) and the flat bottom of the figure can be explained by the fact the SVR has only a single support vector (from its single feature), the figure still does not seem to track the curve that well. To further see if this is an issue with SVR or with the feature, I plotted a 20% sample of the total number of relations against the log of the population in Cell #18."
